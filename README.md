# IPL Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the integration of ball-by-ball data with match data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) to create a comprehensive dataset. Various types of analyses were performed on this dataset to derive meaningful insights about team performances, player contributions, and match trends.

## Objectives
- Merge ball-by-ball data with match details to form a unified dataset.
- Perform exploratory and statistical analyses to uncover hidden patterns.
- Generate insights to enhance understanding of IPL gameplay dynamics.

## Features
- **Data Integration**: Combined ball-by-ball data with match metadata for a holistic view.
- **Analyses Performed**:
  - Player performance trends (e.g., strike rates, economy rates).
  - Team performance evaluations (e.g., win probabilities, scoring rates).
  - Match trends analysis (e.g., season-wise runs, wickets trends).
  - Over-by-over match progression visualization.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Publicly available IPL datasets.
- **Structure**:
